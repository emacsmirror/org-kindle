* Motivation

Because I store ebooks in Org Wiki style database. All ebooks are organized (use
=org-attach=) with links in Org-mode files under some kind of knowledge category
structure directories. So I need to send an ebook to external device with one
keybinding or one command instead of manually copy with complex path (=org-attach=
use some kind of prefix for storing directory).


* Intro

Send org-mode ebook file: link to external devices with corresponding formats.

* Features

- auto send the file under org-mode ~file://~ link to your device like Kindle, NOOK etc.
- auto convert to corresponding formats if necessary. Like send epub to Kindle
  by auto converting to .mobi or .azw3 formats depending on your option
  ~org-send-ebook-kindle-default-format~.

* Usage

You can bind command ~org-send-ebook~ to any keybinding.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(define-key org-mode-map (kbd "<any keybinding you want>") 'org-send-ebook)
#+END_SRC
